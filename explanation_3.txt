## Rearrange Array Elements

After looking at the sample solutions, observed that pairs of combinations of alternate digits will give the the solution if the array is sorted.
Used quick sort to sort the elements as it is more efficient in time and space complexity being in-place sorting algorithm

Efficiency: O(nlog(n))

The method quick_sort() takes O(nlog(n)).
After this we iterate through the array once which takes O(n)
Thus resultant time complexity is O(n) + O(nlog(n)) = O(nlog(n))
