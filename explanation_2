## Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

First tried to modify the conditions in the binary search in order to search element in rotated sorted array.
After failing on multiple attempts and trying different conditions for selecting the mid point, used a method to find the pivot (end of non sorted list)
so that it is easier to search with a point of rotation

Efficiency: O(log(n))
The method rotated_array_search() is the entry point.
It calls a method find_pivot() which uses a method similar to binary search to find the pivot and hence takes O(lon(n)).
After getting pivot, we again use a method similar to binary search which takes O(log(n)).
Thus total time complexity is O(log(n)).
