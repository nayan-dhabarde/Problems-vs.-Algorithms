## HTTPRouter using a Trie

Idea is to use the same technique used while using Trie for autocomplete.
At first I used python string split() function, observed that it cannot handle trailing slash.
Looked on the internet to find time complexity for string.split(), observed that it takes O(N) and created an own implementation which takes similar time and handles trailing slash.


Efficiency:
Insert:
1. We are splitting the path string which takes O(A)
2. We are traversing over this elements which were split which takes O(B)
Thus total time complexity is O(A + B) for insert

Lookup:
1. We are splitting the path string which takes O(A)
2. We are traversing over this elements which were split which takes O(B)
Thus total time complexity is O(A + B) for Lookup
